## Repository Overview

### Project Type
This is a **minimal test/learning repository** designed for practicing Git workflows, branching strategies, and collaboration patterns. It is NOT a production codebase.

### Current State
- **Active Files:** 2 plain text files (`my.txt`, `main.txt`)
- **Programming Language:** None (plain text only)
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Build System:** None
- **Testing Framework:** None
- **Documentation:** This file (CLAUDE.md)

### Primary Use Cases
- Learning and practicing Git commands
- Testing pull request workflows
- Demonstrating branch management
- Experimenting with file lifecycle operations
- Practicing merge conflict resolution

---

## Codebase Structure

### Directory Layout

```
git-test/
├── .git/                  # Git version control metadata
├── CLAUDE.md             # This file - AI assistant documentation
├── main.txt              # Empty placeholder file (0 bytes)
└── my.txt                # Test content file (contains "kusal kusal")
```

### File Inventory

| File | Size | Purpose | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| `my.txt` | 13 bytes | Contains test content for demonstration | **ACTIVE** |
| `main.txt` | 0 bytes | Empty placeholder/marker file | **ACTIVE** |
| `CLAUDE.md` | - | Documentation for AI assistants | **ACTIVE** |

### Deleted Files (Historical)
The following files existed in previous commits but have been removed:
- `1.txt` - Temporary test file
- `main.php` - PHP test file (no actual code)
- `wow.txt` - Test content file
- `wow2.txt` - Test content file

**Important:** The pattern of creating and deleting these files demonstrates intentional Git workflow practice, not accidental file management.

## Development Workflows

### Branch Strategy

This repository follows a **feature branch workflow**:

1. **Feature Branches:** Development work happens on dedicated branches
   - Historical examples: `dev1`, `prod`
   - Current example: `claude/claude-md-mi9p6afnr38zb2kt-012jM4gzy29MLe1fovfewYDd`

2. **Integration:** Changes are merged back via pull requests

3. **Branch Naming Conventions:**
   - Developer branches: `dev1`, `dev2`, `prod`
   - Claude Code branches: `claude/claude-md-{session-id}-{unique-id}`

### Pull Request Workflow

**Evidence from History:**
- PR #1: `kusal-tharindu/prod` merged (2025-11-14)
- PR #3: `kusal-tharindu/dev1` merged (2025-11-14)

**Standard Process:**
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push branch to origin
4. Open pull request
5. Review and merge
6. Delete feature branch (optional)

### File Management Pattern

The repository demonstrates systematic file lifecycle management:

1. **Creation:** Add new files on feature branches
2. **Modification:** Update existing files with meaningful changes
3. **Deletion:** Remove files that are no longer needed
4. **Documentation:** Describe changes in commit messages

---

## Git Conventions

### Commit Message Styles

The repository shows **two distinct commit message patterns**:

#### Formal Style (Preferred)
```
Create my.txt
Update my.txt
Remove main.php, wow.txt, and wow2.txt files
Add new file 1.txt
```

**Characteristics:**
- Imperative mood ("Create", "Update", "Remove", "Add")
- Descriptive and specific
- Easy to understand changes at a glance

#### Informal Style (Testing Only)
```
tst
ugu
wow
```

**Characteristics:**
- Single words or abbreviations
- Used during rapid testing/experimentation
- Not recommended for collaborative work

#### Merge Commit Style
```
Merge pull request #X from kusal-tharindu/branch-name
```

**Characteristics:**
- Auto-generated by GitHub
- Preserves PR context
- Includes branch name and PR number

### Author Identity

**Two Git Identities Present:**

1. **Local Git User:**
   - Name: `kusal`
   - Email: `kusaltharindudtk@gmail.com`
   - Commits: 8

2. **GitHub User:**
   - Name: `Kusal Tharindu`
   - Email: `121029350+kusal-tharindu@users.noreply.github.com`
   - Commits: 4 (mostly merges)

**Recommendation:** Maintain consistent identity for better attribution and collaboration.

## Guidelines for AI Assistants

### When Working with This Repository

#### 1. Understand the Context
- This is a **testing/learning repository**, not production code
- Changes should be experimental and educational in nature
- There are no strict code quality requirements (no linting, testing, etc.)

#### 2. Respect the Workflow
- Always work on feature branches (never commit directly to main)
- Use descriptive commit messages (formal style preferred)
- Push to the designated Claude Code branch when specified
- Follow the pull request workflow when appropriate

#### 3. File Operations
Since this repository uses plain text files:
- Use `Read` tool to examine file contents before modifications
- Use `Edit` tool for small changes to existing files
- Use `Write` tool only for new files or complete rewrites
- Document all file operations in commit messages

#### 4. Git Operations Best Practices

**Committing:**
```bash
# Stage specific files
git add filename.txt

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add feature X to filename.txt"
```

**Pushing:**
```bash
# Push to designated branch with upstream tracking
git push -u origin claude/branch-name
```

**Fetching Updates:**
```bash
# Fetch specific branch
git fetch origin branch-name

# Pull with merge
git pull origin branch-name
```

#### 5. Creating New Files
When adding new files:
- Choose meaningful names that indicate purpose
- Add appropriate content (not just placeholders)
- Document the purpose in the commit message
- Consider whether the file should be tracked long-term

#### 6. Deleting Files
When removing files:
- Use `git rm filename` to remove from Git tracking
- Explain why the file is being removed in commit message
- Verify deletion doesn't break any workflows (minimal risk here)

#### 7. Documentation Updates
When this repository evolves:
- Update CLAUDE.md to reflect new patterns
- Document new conventions as they emerge
- Keep the file inventory current
- Update historical context with significant changes

### Common Tasks

#### Task: Add a New Text File
```bash
# Create the file
echo "content" > newfile.txt

# Stage and commit
git add newfile.txt
git commit -m "Create newfile.txt with initial content"

# Push to branch
git push -u origin current-branch-name
```

#### Task: Update Existing File
```bash
# Use Edit tool to modify content
# Then stage and commit
git add modified-file.txt
git commit -m "Update modified-file.txt: describe what changed"
git push
```

#### Task: Remove File
```bash
# Remove from Git
git rm obsolete-file.txt
git commit -m "Remove obsolete-file.txt: explain reason"
git push
```

#### Task: Check Repository Status
```bash
# View current status
git status

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# View branch information
git branch -a
```

## Historical Context

### Repository Evolution

**Phase 1: Initial Experimentation (2025-11-14, Early)**
- Created temporary test files (`wow.txt`, `wow2.txt`)
- Practiced basic Git operations
- Used informal commit messages during rapid testing

**Phase 2: Branch & PR Practice (2025-11-14, Mid)**
- Created feature branches (`prod`, `dev1`)
- Executed pull request workflow (#1, #3)
- Cleaned up temporary files

**Phase 3: Stabilization (2025-11-14, Late)**
- Established core files (`my.txt`, `main.txt`)
- Removed unnecessary test files
- Improved commit message quality

**Phase 4: AI Integration (2025-11-22)**
- Claude Code branch created
- CLAUDE.md documentation added
- Repository formalized for AI assistant collaboration

### Key Learnings from History

1. **File Churn is Normal:** Don't be afraid to create and delete test files
2. **Commits Tell a Story:** Even informal commits provide workflow insights
3. **PRs Work:** The pull request workflow was successfully practiced
4. **Cleanup Matters:** Regular removal of obsolete files keeps repo tidy

### Future Directions

Potential evolution paths for this repository:

- **Add .gitignore:** Exclude editor backups, system files
- **Add README.md:** Provide user-facing documentation
- **Add LICENSE:** Specify repository usage terms
- **Branch Protection:** Implement rules for main branch
- **Templates:** Add PR and issue templates
- **Hooks:** Set up Git hooks for automation
- **CI/CD:** Practice GitHub Actions or other automation
